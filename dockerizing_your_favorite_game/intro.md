"Dockerizing your Favorite Game" is a tutorial presenting a general approach to dockerizing a game for self-contained cross-platform use. Aspects of both cross-platform distribution as well as dependency management will hence be presented. We will show you how to create a versatile Docker-container that can be extended to support multiple platforms. The focus is on the general approach to such, rather than to actually create a katacoda-session supporting multiple platforms. However, by following the examples you will ultimately be able to play a game of Tetris at the end.
