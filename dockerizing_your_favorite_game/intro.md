"Dockerizing your Favorite Game" is a tutorial presenting a general approach to dockerizing a game for self-contained cross-platform use. A way to add dependencies to the container is thereby described. We will show you how to create a versatile Docker-container that can be extended to support multiple platforms. The focus is on the general approach to this rather than to actually create a katacoda-session supporting multiple platforms. However, by following the examples you will ultimately be able to play a game of Tetris at the end.
