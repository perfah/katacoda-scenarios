"Dockerizing your Favorite Game" is a tutorial presenting a general approach to placing a game within a self-contained environment playable on multiple platforms. Aspects of both cross-platform distribution as well as dependency management will hence be presented. We will show you how to create a versatile "Docker container" that theoretically can run on a wide array of systems. Note that the focus is on the general approach to such, rather than to actually create a katacoda-session supporting multiple platforms. However, by following the examples you will ultimately be able to play a game of Tetris at the end.

**Background:**

"Docker" is a suite of "platform as a service" (PaaS) products that offer "containers" to work with. A finalized container is an isolated environment that is capable of delivering the experience it was created for without involving the user in unnecessary details (e.g. software setup, dependencies, configuration files and even the platform used). Yes, Docker in fact offers (some experimental) features that will allow you to abstract away from an impressive set of otherwise concerning factors.
